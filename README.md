# Sign-up Form

Sign-up Form is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) consisting of a web page with sign up form.

Web page has image banner on the left and form on the right. The form consists of 6 input fiels with labels on top of them. Matching of password input fiels are checked by JavaScript using event listener. Submit button located outside the form but still submits form data using event listener in JavaScript.

To build this project, I used knowledge of everything I learned in Forms section in Intermediate HTML and CSS Course including new CSS units, advanced selectors and positioning.
